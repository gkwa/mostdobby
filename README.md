# Mostdobby
## Purpose

Watch for changes on a directory and do some action after some
timeout.

## Motivation

I recently discovered Obsidian and I'm commiting changes to git and
having them pushed to github.

When Obsidian Vault changes I want to commit and push but with option
to add arbitrary timeout.

## Usage

``` bash
make && ./mostdobby watch /tmp
```
